# Major classes in IKBT

This will introduce some major classes which hold data used by IKBT solver nodes/leaves. 
These are collected and posted onto the BT blackboard for visibility to the leaves. 


The classes will be described in  a bottom up manner from lowest level to highest level.
Only the most important or most widely used members of each class will be described here.

## unknown
**File:**  `ikbtbasics/kin_cl.py`

This class represents each unknown which must be solved for.   

**Highlights:**
```
symbol          # how to print this unknown
eqnlist         # kequations containing this unknown
readytosolve    # True/False
solved          # True/False
solutions[]     # list of solutions for this unk.
```


## kequation
**File:**  'ikbtbasics/kin_cl.py`

This represents a single kinematic equation having a left hand and right hand side. 

**Highlights:**
```
LHS             # a sympy expression for left  hand side
RHS             #     "       "          right hand side
```


## matrix_equation
**File:** `ikbtbasics/kin_cl.py`

An equation in which each side is a 4x4 matrix.

**Highlights:**
```
Td             # the left hand side: desired end effector configuration (known)
Ts             # the right hand side: symbolic FK equations containing unknowns.
```


## mechanism
**File:**  `ikbtbasics/kin_cl.py`

Kinematic parameters and methods for a serial-chain mechanism.

**Highlights:**
```
DH              # the Denavit Hartenburg Parameter Table (must have 6 rows)
vv              # variables vector (1 = rotary joint, 0 = prismatic joint)
params          # constant parameters (e.g. l_2, d_1)
jlims           # joint limits

forward_kinematics()    # compute the fk equations
get_mequation_set()     # derives mequations transformed into each link frame
scan_for_equations()    # get unsolved kequations from lists of matrix_equations and auxiliary
                        #  sum-of-angle (SOA) equations
scan_Mequation()        # get list of kequations from a matrix_equation
sum_of_angle_transform()# identify and convert SOA terms in the mechanism
```

Notes:  

- `DH, vv, params, jlims` should be set in `ikbtfunctions/ik_robots.py`


## Robot

**File:** `ikbtbasics/ik_classes.py`

Highest level class to represent a target robot for IK solution.

**Highlights:**
```
notation_graph          # solution graph with subscripted solution numbers. (its a set!)
mequation_list[]        # all 4x4 matrix FK equations (generated by get_mequation_set()?)
kequation_aux_list[]    # SOA definitions eg:  th_23 = th_2 + th_3
SOA_eqns                # a single matrix_equation containing up to 16 SOA equations 
Mech                    # the mechanism of the Robot
```
